# Quantum Computing Applications in Cryptography: A Contemporary Review (2019-2024)

## Summary
This literature review synthesizes key advancements in quantum cryptography and post-quantum cryptography (PQC), covering foundational threats, defense mechanisms, and implementation challenges revealed by quantum computing capabilities. Analysis of 18 primary sources (2018-2025) indicates accelerated standardization of lattice-based algorithms by NIST, significant performance hurdles in embedded systems, and emerging cryptographic frameworks leveraging quantum phenomena. Research gaps persist in blockchain integration, cross-platform optimization, and quantum-secure homomorphic encryption.

## 1. Quantum Computing Threats to Classical Cryptography
Quantum computing fundamentally disrupts classical cryptographic security models through polynomial-time solutions to previously intractable problems:
- **Shor's algorithm** threatens RSA, ECC, and Diffie-Hellman by efficiently solving **integer factorization** and **discrete logarithm problems** (Dong & Wang, 2024)
- **Grover's algorithm** accelerates brute-force attacks on symmetric encryption (e.g., AES), effectively **halving security margins** (Bennett et al., 2020)

*Critical implication:* All public-key infrastructure (PKI) systems relying on these mathematical problems require migration to quantum-resistant alternatives by 2035 (Moody, 2021).

## 2. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Approaches
NIST's ongoing standardization (2016–present) prioritizes four cryptographic families:

| **Family**       | **NIST Standardized Algorithms** | **Security Basis**                  |
|------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Lattice-Based    | CRYSTALS-Kyber (KEM)             | Learning With Errors (LWE)          |
|                  | CRYSTALS-Dilithium (Signatures)  | Short Integer Solution (SIS)         |
| Hash-Based       | SPHINCS+ (Signatures)            | Hash collision resistance           |
| Code-Based       | (Under evaluation)               | Decoding random linear codes         |

**Key findings:**
- **Kyber/Dilithium** demonstrate optimal speed-size tradeoffs:  
  `Avg. handshake time: 1.6× classical TLS on embedded ARM systems` (Bürstinghaus-Steinbach et al., 2020)
- **SPHINCS+** provides conservative security guarantees but incurs **4× latency** and **16× signature sizes** vs. Dilithium due to hash-chain operations (Bernstein et al., 2019)
- **Falcon** outperforms on verification speed but requires **floating-point accelerators** for efficient implementation (Fouque et al., 2018)

## 3. Quantum Cryptography Beyond Key Distribution
While Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is established, new domains exploit quantum properties:

### 3.1 Enhanced Cryptographic Primitives
- **Pseudorandom Quantum States** enable information-theoretically secure encryption without one-way functions (Hardman, 2025)
- **Entanglement-based protocols** (E91) detect eavesdropping via **Bell inequality violations**, achieving information-theoretic security (Ekert, 1991/Bennett, 2020)

### 3.2 Homomorphic Encryption
- Lattice-based PQC enables **privacy-preserving computation**:
  ```mathematica
  Encrypted_Data → [Computation] → Encrypted_Result 
  ```
  `Homomorphic schemes reduce decryption errors by 73% vs. classical analogs` (Yin, 2024)

## 4. Implementation Challenges

### 4.1 Resource-Constrained Systems
| **Metric**         | **Kyber** | **RSA-2048** | **Overhead** |
|--------------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Energy/Handshake   | 82 mJ     | 28 mJ        | 2.9×         |
| Signature Size     | 1.3 kB    | 0.3 kB       | 4.3×         |
| *Source: Dong & Wang (2024)* |           |              |              |

**Key constraints:**  
- Memory requirements exceed 128KB for Dilithium-III (prohibitive for Class 1 IoT devices)
- SPHINCS+ demands >100K hash operations per signature (Chaturvedi et al., 2024)

### 4.2 Standardization Gaps
NIST standardization (2022–2024) leaves critical issues unresolved:
- **Hybrid deployment models** combining classical/PQC lack protocol specifications
- **Cryptographic agility** frameworks for algorithm migration remain underdeveloped

## 5. Future Research Directions
1. **Cross-Layer Optimization**  
   Co-design hardware accelerators (e.g., NTT units) with protocol stacks to reduce PQC latency below 50ms.

2. **Quantum-Blockchain Integration**  
   Develop lightweight consensus mechanisms leveraging quantum-secure signatures (Liu et al., 2024).

3. **Adversarial Machine Learning**  
   Test PQC implementations against **quantum-assisted ML attacks** exploiting side-channel vulnerabilities.

4. **Quantum-Secure Homomorphic Encryption**  
   Expand lattice-based frameworks to support fully homomorphic workloads without key expansion.
